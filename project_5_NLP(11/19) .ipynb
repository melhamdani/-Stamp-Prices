At the age of 21, Morrell was recruited to the Australian Football League by the North Melbourne Football Club with it’s third round selection in the 2001 AFL Rookie Draft. As a forward he twice kicked five goals during his time with the Kangaroos. The first was in a losing cause against Sydney in 2002 and the other the following season in a drawn game against Brisbane.\n",

He played 32 games for the Blues before being delisted at the end of 2005. He continued to play Victorian Football League (VFL) football with the Northern Bullants, Carlton's VFL-affiliate in 2006, and acted as playing assistant coach in 2007. In 2008, he shifted to the Box Hill Hawks, before retiring from playing at the end of the season. From 2009 until 2013, Morrell was the senior coach of the Strathmore Football Club in the Essendon District Football League, leading the club to the 2011 Premier Division premiership.from 2014 - 2018 he was the senior coach of the West Coburg Football Club, also in the EDFL.\n",

In 2001 he was controversially banned for 4 matches for making contact with an umpire.
